We believe that whenever a business or policy consulting team, a research institute, or data journalism team has already used, formatted, and analyzed data from an external source at least twice, this procedure should be automated. This makes it error-free, well documented, cheap and re-useable. Furthermore, making data collection ongoing instead being ad hoc saves data acquisition, validation and supervision costs. We would like to help medium-sized business, policy, NGO, scientific and data journalism organizations in this, who do not have the institutional capacity to hire data scientists and engineers.\nOur solutions cover automating data acquisition, processing, validation, auditing, documentation, visualization and presentation workflows, so that they can focus on what humans are best: making sense of the data.\nReprex means reproducible example in data science. When you are stuck with a problem, creating a reproducible example allows other computer scientists, statisticians, programmers or data users to solve it. In 80% of the cases, you usually find the solution while creating a generalized example \u0026ndash; which also means that you never have to repeat this task again. If you have ever downloaded, formatted, visualized, cited a datasource twice in your work, there is a high chance that you will need it again. We would like to make this process automatic, with daily updating the data, the formatting, the visualizations and the citations.\nIn the 20% other cases, you can reach out for help easily. We want to help you making your codes, data ingestions, document and presentation templates reproducible, and give help when you are stuck. Call us!\nAn observatory is a location used for observing terrestrial or celestial events. We are building highly automated data observatories in the fields of business, policy and social sciences to support research and development and evidence-based policymaking. We are following the best practices of reproducible research.\nThe observatories give a comprehensive view of our minimal viable products. We are working on the launch of three observatories, starting with music.dataobservatory.eu and ccs.dataobservatory.eu that we will finalize until 14 September 2020. Our Demo Music Observatory is already partially functional, and showcases all of the elements of reproducible research workflow, but some implementation (automatic doi versioning) and a full selection of the indicators is not yet finished. Out of our 2000 pan-European indicators, we will select about 50-50 in our demo observatories for daily refreshed availability.\nWhenever we collaborate with members of the open source, open data community, we apply the Contributor Covenant.\nDo you want to help our start? We would like to enter into the Validation Lab of one of the best artificial intelligence incubators in early September. Talented team members, letters of intents and assignments from organizations will give a lot of credibility to our start Meet our team ».\n  Put as in contact with people who love to write code in R and interested in automating business and social science research and primary data collection such as surveying.

This was a particularly difficult period for everybody. We aspired to deliver by September in a very different environment, our hopes for commissioned work went up in flames with the pandemic, and our targeted users, musicians and music entrepreneurs, talent managers, music venues lost most of their income. The organizations helping them, granting authorities, export offices and collective management societies are overwhelmed with the problem. During these troublesome times, our team expanded, attracted great new talent, and kept working.\nOur first product is the Demo Music Observatory, a collaborative, automated research-based observatory for the music industry, one that is particularly hard hit by the COVID19 crisis. Not only great artists, composers, technicians, managers fell victim to the virus, but musicians lost about 50–90% of their income from live music. This translates to a 100% loss for the live music technicians and managers.\n   See our earlier blogpost on what you see on the video.\nThe music industry was never a place for great job security. For putting up a show, you usually need a network of 10–200 artists, technicians and managers to work together as freelancers without all those social benefits that many people enjoy in other walks of life. We have been trying to figure out how to help this microenterprise and freelancer-network based industry with research for five years. Our aim is to make them competitive when they are talking with their buyers: Google, Apple, Spotify, who are really heavy-weight data and AI pros. Our better plan their tours, when they will be back on the road, to understand what sort of audiences and purchasing power waits for them in different European cities.\nWe are launching at a time when the music industry is crying for help.Therefore, we have decided to make our demo observatory open and unfinished. Over the last 7 years, we have built up about 2000 music and creative sector indicators to be used for business KPIs, forecasting targets, grant evaluations, royalty valuations, concert demography target group analysis and other professional uses. We would like to open up, based on your needs, about 50 well-designed indicators, and pledge to keep it daily refreshed, corrected, documented, citaable, downloadable. Also, feel free to use our most valuable source code—use it for your own purposes, even modify it, as long as you keep it open.\nFor our smaller partners, we follow what musicians do these days on Bandcamp: name your price. We make a pledge to our small partners: if you need reliable data to plan your next grant calls, calculate royalties, compensations, predict hit candidates, give us the job—and name your price. Post-corona, you can take for a dollar the best music from Bandcamp. You can take our research products, for a limited period, for any amount you name, as long as it is for a good cause and serves the industry, musicians, technicians or managers. In return, we ask for your feedback. Help us validate whether we are on the right track, tell us how we can cooperate after the pandemic, in better times.\nOur larger and better funded partners? We ask you to pay the price we name, because we believe that it is a well-justified, fair and competitive price, set by pricing experts.\nWe appreciate it if you take a look at our offering, or if you pass this blogpost on to your colleagues in the industry. Our main target audience initially are music professional in broader Europe, but we are planning to cover all major global markets very soon, too. Feedback from the U.S., Australia, Canada, Colombia, Brazil \u0026amp; Argentina is particularly welcome as we have great plans over there!\nWho we are? We started our operations on 1 September 2020 on the basis of CEEMID, a pan-European data observatory that created about 2000 music and creative industry indicators for its users. In the coming days, we are gradually opening up about 50 music industry and 50 broader creative industry indicators in a fully reproducible workflow, with daily re-freshed, re-processed, well-formatted and documented indicators for business and policy decisions.\nWe would like to validate this approach in one of the world\u0026rsquo;s most prestigious university-backed incubator programs, in the Yes!Delft AI/Blockchain Validation Lab. We\u0026rsquo;re finalist on their selection, and all help before 23 September from our friends in the music industry is more than appreciated. If we get there, we can rely on probably the best pros in Europe to make our offering better tailored and financially sustainable.\nGet in touch! We use the very simple and extremely secure keybase.io, a kind of mix of Whatsapp, Skype, Google Drive, One Drive and zoom.

Ex-post data harmonization enables better use of existing data and creates new research opportunities. For example, harmonizing data from different countries enables cross-national comparisons, while merging data from different time points makes it possible to track changes over time.\nRetrospective data harmonization is associated with challenges including conceptual issues with establishing equivalence and comparability, practical complications of having to standardize the naming and coding of variables, technical difficulties with merging data stored in different formats, and the need to document a large number of data transformations. The retroharmonize package assists with the latter three components, freeing up the capacity of researchers to focus on the first.\nSpecifically, the retroharmonize package proposes a reproducible workflow, including a new class for storing data together with the harmonized and original metadata, as well as functions for importing data from different formats, harmonizing data and metadata, documenting the harmonization process, and converting between data types. See here for an overview of the functionalities.\nThe new labelled_spss_survey() class is an extension of haven’s labelled_spss class. It not only preserves variable and value labels and the user-defined missing range, but also gives an identifier, for example, the filename or the wave number, to the vector. Additionally, it enables the preservation – as metadata attributes – of the original variable names, labels, and value codes and labels, from the source data, in addition to the harmonized variable names, labels, and value codes and labels. This way, the harmonized data also contain the pre-harmonization record.

When you are stuck with a problem, creating a reproducible example allows other computer scientists, statisticians, programmers or data users to solve it. In 80% of the cases, you usually find the solution while creating a generalized example. In the 20% other cases, you can reach out for help easily.\n In the coming days, we are launching demo versions of our headline products, data observatories. music.dataobservatory.eu will be a fully automated online service that every day collects, processes, cleans, and publishes scientifically valid data about European music. Very soon after we will launch two other observatories.\nThe creative and cultural sector, NGOs, most research institutions, data journalism teams are usually very small, and they do not have internal IT or data science capacities. We would like to provide them a transparent, high quality, and fully open source solution to acquire data, process it without errors, document it and make sense of it. We would like to embrace the idea of open collaboration among creative enterprises, scientific researchers, NGOs, data journalists and policymakers with our work.\nOur work will comply with the Open Policy Analysis standards developed by the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences \u0026amp; Center for Effective Global Action and the four principles of reproducible research: reviewability, replicability, confirmability and auditability. We believe that these standards apply in reproducible finance, empirical evidence presentation in courts, or advocating sound policies and producing high-quality journalism.\nDo you want to help our start?

Within the EU in the last 20 years there were several thousand internal boundary changes \u0026mdash; states, provinces, regions are rather free to change their internal administration boundaries. Regions are constantly changing their names or their spelling, too. Sometimes they use a standard English translation of their region, sometimes only the national language variants.

Replicability means that somebody else in your team can get exactly the same data as in this post.\n Recording exactly what have your analysts downloaded, including source, date, filtering settings  Reproducibility means that not only your team, but an external auditor or a peer reviewer can easily validate that your data is sound. All our solutions are opens source, and use the most popular statistical programming language, R. Anybody with a basic knowledge of R, or probably even SQL (we use an extension of R that uses SQL-like syntax) can read if everything goes allright. Your team can even modify the code.\n Creating a documentation that you updates your reports data citations  Confirmability means that somebody who is not using . All our solutions are opens source, and use the most popular statistical programming language, R. R is supported by Microsofts BI products, SPSS and other statistical software, too. We are not a software company, there is no vendor lock-in, and our work can be confirmed with other statistical software.\n Data acquired via our data gathering apps is automatically documented, follows tidy formats and valid abbreviations, and can be confirmed in a wide range of statistical and spreadsheet applications, including SPSS, Excel, OpenOffice, Google Spreadsheets. Bringing the data to a tidy format which is easy to join with other data in a spreadsheet application, or stored in a relational database. Validating the data structure, in this case, with special attention to regional boundaries and regional names.  Auditability means that external auditors can validate that the data your team uses from our app is correct.\n We are following methodological guidelines and definitions set by international bodies such as Eurostat\u0026rsquo;s ESSNet statistical network or IFRS. Our critical software code is not only open source, but goes through various levels of statistical peer-review. We are sending for scientific validation and peer-review our methodology, too. Being open source allows us to make any corrections, updates, should any problem or standard change affect the data.  References\rAntal, Daniel. 2020.

Our observatory systems allow users to save thousands of working hours in data collection, in senior supervision, documentation and compliance functions. We want to help business researchers, policymakers, scientists and journalist to focus on what they do best, and use the latest, most complete, and perfectly processed information to support their work.\nOur methodology can be used in business consultancy, evidence-based policy making, social and management science and data journalism. We thrive to support all these communities, because by incorporating their different review, confirmation and auditing processing, and provide an even more reliable, robust data services to all of our users.\nReviewability means that our application’s results are can be assessed and judged by our user’s experts, or experts they trust. We not only automate data collection and cleaning, but we also automate documentation.\n Reviewability for professional consultants means that the data is always avaible with the freshest forms and with up-to-date documentation, instead of ad hoc spreadsheets collected, modified and overwritten by junior staff. The usual error-prone work that junior staff does is done by our observatory system automatically, and all the latest spreadsheets are available for all staff. Reviewability in a scientific context means that our observatory systems produce the research data in a well-documented format that adheres to the expectation of social scientific and management science peer-review. Reviewability in data journalism means that all the data is automatically refreshed and present for journalistic and editorial source-checking and analysis.  Reproducibility means that we are providing data products and tools that allow the exact duplication of our results during assessments. The most important aspect of our reproducibility is that we make the entire statistical program code either fully open source, or make the entire algorithm available for our clients. From the raw data that they give us, or we collect for them, they can arrive step-by-step to the same indicator or KPI values. Reproducibility ensures that there is no lock-in to our applications. You can always chose a different data and software vendor, or compare our results with them.\n Reproducibility in a consulting context means that our data is well-processed and described, and a senior analyst can re-create it, or even modify it to the organizations needs. In a scientific context it means that other researchers can reproduce the scientific findings which are supported by our data, because it is of high quality, well formatted and documented. In data journalism this means that journalist can reliably follow leads and sources over a longer period of time.  We are creating applications that are confirmable and auditable. These are usually required by the ethical guidelines and professional standards of our users.\nConfirmability means that using our applications findings leads to the same professional results as other available software and information. Our data products use the open-source statistical programming language R. We provide details about our algorithms and methodology to confirm our results in SPSS or Stata or sometimes even in Excel or OpenOffice. Confirmability is often a requirement of various ethical guideleins and professional standards that our clients must adhere to in the legal, economic or policy-making professions.\n Reproducibility in a consulting context means that our data is well-processed and described, and a senior analyst can re-create it, or even modify it to the organizations needs. They can confront the data with their qualitative results or parallel information bases. In a scientific context it means that other researchers can reproduce the scientific findings which are supported by our data, because it is of high quality, well formatted and documented. If any issues are raised with scientific confirmation, we assist our scientific partner to amend, replace or correct the problematic data. In data journalism this means that journalist can reliably follow leads and sources over a longer period of time. We review the entire data pipeline if our journalistic partners find contrary evidence or red flags with our data sources.  Auditability means that our data and software is archived in a way that external auditors can later review, reproduce and confirm our findings. This is a stricter form of data retention that most organizations apply, because we do not only archive results step-by-step but all computational steps – as if your colleagues would not only save every step in Excel but also their keystrokes. While auditability is a requirement in accounting, but we are extending this approach to all the quantitative work of a professional organization in an advisory or consulting capacity.\n Auditability means that we are following professional guidelines and standards of various statistical, accounting, national accounting and other professional bodies to develop our indicators and data products, and we allow auditors to review not only our data, but the entire history of the data processing, including key elements of our software code, and our general methodology. Auditability means for us that we make our critical methods and software code available for peer-review both as a software on CRAN and as a statistical method in an appropriate, peer-reviewed journal. In a data journalism context our data products can be subject to full editorial and journalistic review, from source to publication.

In popular music performers usually play their own composition and sing their own lyrics. If the musician is self-published, all the three royalties directly pay the artist’s work. If a professional publisher is helping the artist as a composer, or a record producer as a recorded performer, they usually share the respective royalty revenues. In emerging markets fewer, in mature markets more composers are represented by publishers and performers by record labels.\nClassification of Industries The nature of the creative jobs is that they contain a wide range of activities. Economists and government policymakers classify industries with the Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne, in short, with the NACE classification in Europe. This classification is largely harmonized on UN level and can be used to compare almost all economies in the world. The NACE classification has its origins in the economic structure of the middle 20th century, and it is more appropriate for the classification of manufacturing and trading activities, such as car manufacturing, or retail sale of cars.\nThe music industry is not even recognized by the NACE classification. For example, musicians often perform music (NACE group 90), compose music (NACE group 90), and at the same time do sound recordings (NACE group 58) and teach music (NACE group 85). Many EU member states do not even create government economic statistics for the NACE 90 classes.\nThis is the main reason why music is not well represented in governmental statistics, which is mainly based on tax returns data from ‘clear’ activity groups, such as sound recordings only. Most creative enterprises, and music businesses are no excemptions, do not have a clear economic activity.\nMicroenterprises \u0026amp; Freelancers The music industry, for various reasons, is not part of the NACE industry, and music industry data must be mapped from different data sources. A further difficulty is that music industry, similarly to the other creative and cultural industries, mainly works in freelancer networks and microenterprises. All over Europe, microenterprises are exempted from many statistical reporting, and they are filing simplified tax and financial reports.\nThe government statistics are largely based on tax returns and other filings of corporate entities with at least 5 employees. While most manufacturing or trading activities, or licensed service activities such as insurance or banking, are easy to classify, the creative industries are different. Because most creative enterprises are smaller than 5 people, they do not file many data for the government or the tax authorities, and they often carry out heterogeneous activities. For example, the music industry is not even recognized by the NACE classification – the live music and compositions can be found in the NACE 90 class, and the sound recordings in the NACE 58 class, and many countries do not even create government economic statistics for the NACE 90 classes.\nStandardized mapping CEEMID has been mapping data sources for composer, producer and performer royalties, and other data sources since 2014, based on the standard mapping technique developed originally in the United States and later adopted to the EU ^[Hull, Geoffrey P., Thomas W.

Some collective management organizations provided us with anonymous payout lists, which was essential to validate the representativeness of our samples. We reconstructed the density function of actual payouts, and collected data until our anonymous responses showed a very accurately similar shape.\nBecause the music industry all over Europe is mainly made of microenterprise and freelancers, getting an overal picture of the music industry is very difficult.\n","date":1594368000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594368000,"objectID":"9cc302a19c1bf62edafb20751399261f","permalink":"/faq/data_maps/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T10:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/faq/data_maps/","section":"faq","summary":"The copyright and neighboring right royalty is the wage-like earning of the music performer, the composer and producer.

The EU has been opening up its own survey programs in a piecemeal fashion, and surveys used by the European Commission, the Parliament, or even the national statistical offices are becoming more and more available. After harmonizing the questions, I can apply ex post harmonization of the results, too, resulting in a far more valuable research document:\n I can usually compare the basic values, such as concert visiting likelihood in the past – for example, I surveyed Hungary and Slovakia first in 2015, but immediately could compare with 2013 and 2007 data.  I get international benchmarks for free, for example, German, Czech, French data.  Using the hierarchical nature of CAP surveys, I can make reasonable estimates of details that I survey only in one or few countries, such as visiting jazz concerts, and not concert only; or copying non-licensed music to devices.

In policymaking or in social sciences, it is a common practice to compare national statistics, which can be hugely misleading. The United States of America, the Federal Republic of Germany, Slovakia and Luxembourg are all countries, but they differ vastly in size and social homogeneity. Comparing Slovakia and Luxembourg to the federal states or even regions within Germany, or the states of Germany and the United States can provide more adequate insights. Statistically, the similarity of the aggregation level and high number of observations can allow more precise control of model parameters and errors.\nThe advantages of switching from a national level of the analysis to a sub-national level comes with a huge price in data processing, validation and imputation. The package Regions aims to help this process.\nThis package is an offspring of the eurostat package on rOpenGov. It started as a tool to validate and re-code regional Eurostat statistics, but it aims to be a general solution for all sub-national statistics. It will be developed parallel with other rOpenGov packages.\nSub-national Statistics Have Many Challenges   Frequent boundary changes: as opposed to national boundaries, the territorial units, typologies are often change, and this makes the validation and recoding of observation necessary across time. For example, in the European Union, sub-national typologies change about every three years and you have to make sure that you compare the right French region in time, or, if you can make the time-wise comparison at all.\n  Hierarchical aggregation and special imputation: missingness is very frequent in sub-national statistics, because they are created with a serious time-lag compared to national ones, and because they are often not back-casted after boundary changes. You cannot use standard imputation algorithms because the observations are not similarly aggregated or averaged. Often, the information is seemingly missing, and it is present with an obsolete typology code.\n  Package functionality  Generic vocabulary translation and joining functions for geographically coded data Keeping track of the boundary changes within the European Union between 1999-2021 Vocabulary translation and joining functions for standardized European Union statistics Vocabulary translation for the ISO-3166-2 based Google data and the European Union Imputation functions from higher aggregation hierarchy levels to lower ones, for example from NUTS1 to NUTS2 or from ISO-3166-1 to ISO-3166-2 (impute down) Imputation functions from lower hierarchy levels to higher ones (impute up) Aggregation function from lower hierarchy levels to higher ones, for example from NUTS3 to NUTS1 or from ISO-3166-2 to ISO-3166-1 (aggregate; under development) Disaggregation functions from higher hierarchy levels to lower ones, again, for example from NUTS1 to NUTS2 or from ISO-3166-1 to ISO-3166-2 (disaggregate; under development)  Vignettes / Articles   Working With Regional, Sub-National Statistical Products  Validating Your Typology  Recoding And Relabelling  The Typology Of The Google Mobility Reports (COVID-19)  Feedback?

The dataset can be downloaded from Zenodo.

Visited a public library the answer option Limited or poor quality of this activity in the place where you live. In this case, the number of respondents is rather low and this is not a very reliable statistic on regional level.\nScience \u0026amp; Technology Attitudes The supports open access variable is a weighted sum of yes answer options to the QD 17 Do you think that the results of publicly funded research should be made available online free of charge? question.\nDemography The internet access question is a weighted sum of responses to the answer option for D46 Which of the following do you have? - An Internet connection at home.\nThe internet access question is a weighted sum of responses to the answer option for D15 What is your current occupation? - student.\nData Source \u0026amp; Data Processing The source of the data is the microdata file stored in GESIS for the Eurobarometer 79.2 survey.\nThis data file contains the microdata for the Eurobarometer 79.2 survey (TNS Opinion \u0026amp; Social 2013), which includes a Cultural Access and Participation Survey (see (Haan and Broek 2012; Bína, Vladimir et al.2012)) and a Science \u0026amp; Technology Attitude survey.\nThe survey samples are designed to represent the national population, with the exceptions of Northern Ireland, the former East- and West-Germany, and the Turkish community on Cyprus. These samples are designed to be representative for these populations, too.\nFor weighting we used the w1 weights, which allow for post-stratification based on gender, education level and community size.\nIn the case of the Republic of Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg and Malta regionalization is not necessary because the entire countries are equivalent to a single NUTS2 region in terms of size and homogeneity. In these countries the weighting produces representative statistics.\nUnfortunately, due to a problem with the original data file, no regional information is available for the Republic of Ireland.\nIn the case of Germany, Great Britain and Italy, data can be summarized on the level of NUTS1 territories, and we are imputing these values into the constituent (smaller sub-)regions on NUTS2 levels. In the case of the remaining countries it can be summarized on NUTS2 levels.\nBecause the survey samples are designed to be nationally representative, the regional sub-samples are not necessarily representative, and often they are very small. For post stratification purposes, we created a “dirty weighting”, Using the national w1 post-stratification weights, but centered to an average value of 1 for each region.\nWe believe that this causes problems on more detailed answer options (on the level levels of the questionnaire’s question hierarchy.) Except for the science attitudes and the library quality questions, we used relatively simple questions that are less affected by the small, potentially biased sample size\nA better option would be the creation of new, regional post-stratification weights. We believe that this would be a very interesting, but very big research task that would potentially need the cooperation of the survey’s producer, Kantar.\nUpdate: This was originally posted on Daniel\u0026rsquo;s blog. eurobarometer became a much more useful and ex post survey harmonization tool after Marta joined the development efforts\nCitation Daniel, Antal. 2020. “Regionalized Cultural Access and Participation (Books And Libraries) And Science Attitudes Variables 2013.” Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3759811.\nBína, Vladimir, Chantepie, Philippe, Deboin, Valérie, Kommel, Kutt, Kotynek, Josef, and Robin, Philippe. 2012. “ESSnet-CULTURE, European Statistical System Network on Culture.

We’re all hoping for new information about the progress against the coronavirus. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these charts is meaningless. In fact, coronavirus case counts are meaningless, unless they are done with very heavy statistical knowledge, and even then they are very messy. Countries have different testing and hospitalization protocols, death certificating standards, and there are less and more trustworthy governments. We do not really know the severity of the local epidemics and the relative success of public health policies.\n    Nevertheless, we have some timely information on how people and the economy react to the epidemic, because there are ongoing, frequent, and comparable data sources on various consequences of the epidemic. A particularly interesting big data source is Google’s geolocational reporting on how people’s time spent in homes, workplaces, parks, shopping areas and recreational areas change. Google gets plenty of realtime data from hundreds of millions of people and compares them by days in the week and local time with the ‘baseline’ scenario before the outbreak of the coronavirus.\nBased on the locational data of various smartphones and application data, we know that people spend 10-15% more time at home since January, and 40-50% less in their workplaces. Similar data is available for other locations.\nWhile people are spending less time in the workplace and more at home in every European country, there are significant differences. Countries in the top left corner, most notable Sweden, switched less from workplaces to homes. On the bottom right corner, Spain and Italy, which were most hit by the epidemic, are in the most severe form of lockdown.\nThere are some outliers, like Romania, where people stay a lot more at home, but not so much less in the workplaces – probably they cannot afford to stay clear of the job, but they are reducing other activities. Or, in the case of Germany, people spend a lot more time in parks.\nI grouped the countries according to their dynamics. Looking at Belgium and Luxembourg, we see that they are more locked down than the typical European country, but they are moving up in the first week of April compared to the last week of March. This is very much in line with their improving strain on the health system.\nWhat is worrying is that there appears to be a significant asynchronicity in the Schengen zone, where people and goods should move around freely. The peripheric countries, which are less densely populated, often less integrated into the global transport and travel routes, are getting into the local epidemics later, and are acting later. This is logical from a national point of view, but given that the European economy is very much integrated, it will prolong the pain. The Netherlands, France and Germany need plenty of seasonal agricultural workers from the Southeast, where the lockdown is just getting really strict. While some of their regions see improving national epidemic situations, the easing will increase the intensity of the local epidemic if a large number of workers will arrive from countries that are just going into the epidemic.\nThe efficient solution, as many public health officials keep saying, would be a synchronized effort to contain the virus. The different pace and strictness of social distancing measures will mean that the local epidemics will not be in synchronization, and the countries will re-infect each other, this way prolonging the economic and social cost of this devastating pandemic. While health policy is a national competence in the European Union, in fact, the European economic and social life is so much integrated, not only within the Schengen Zone, but even with future, prospective and candidate members states in the Balkans, that a far more coordinated public health policy would be required.\nUse this in your article?

This is only possible in a collaborative way, because the combined research capacity of the European industry is smaller than its main partner’s capacities individually.\nWe believe that CEEMID could fulfil the functions of the European Music Industry if it would find a sustainable financing that makes access to all our data open. We need to be able to avoid the tragedy of the commons, where only a few industry users contribute to the financing of thousands of indicators that could potentially benefits tens of thousands of stakeholders in the EU.\nWe believe that a very large segment of CEEMID\u0026rsquo;s and the European Music Observatory\u0026rsquo;s data coverage is based on public-interest data that is collected by public authorities. We have also realized that the music industry stakeholders and policymakers, particularly in cultural ministries and similar functions in cities and regions underestimate the availability of open data. The EU open data regime gives access to almost all information stored in government data systems. Because this is in fact re-use of the information, the data for this purpose is usually not documented. While the data is available for free or almost free, only high level of metadata and data processing know-how is required to access it. This know-how is usually missing from cultural policy institutions and music industry bodies.\nTherefore, CEEMID was based on the regulatory framework provided by the Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information provides a common legal framework for a European market for government-held data (public sector information). It a regulatory framework that is built around two key pillars of the internal market: transparency and fair competition. In our view, these principles should apply to European Music Observatory, too.\nIn the EU, open data is governed by the Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information - in short: Open Data Directive (EU) 2019/1024. It entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the Public Sector Information Directive, also known as the ‘PSI Directive’ which dated from 2003 and was subsequently amended in 2013^[@eu_directive_2019_1024; @eu_directive_2013_37; @eu_directive_2003_98]. The founder of CEEMID, Daniel Antal has been involved in Open Data and PSI since 2008.\nWhy open collaboration in data integration? We believe that the European Music Observatory must rely on open-source statistical software written in the R statistical language like CEEMID, and it must be funded on the principle of open collaboration with the industry, public authorities and academia.\nOpen-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software is often developed in a collaborative public manner, and which is a prominent example of open collaboration.\nGenerally, the use of open source software, including the open source R language and its software packages or libraries in the national statistical offices are encouraged by four important considerations:\n lower cost, 2. security, 3. no vendor \u0026lsquo;lock in\u0026rsquo; and 4. better quality. We believe that the number of data scientists in the music domain is so few that only an open collaboration can guarantee adequate data quality. (In our CEEMID documentation you find more information about the [R language](https://documentation.ceemid.eu/index.php?title=R_(programming_language) and the concept of open-source software.)  We believe that the European Music Observatory must rely on open-source statistical software written in the R statistical language like CEEMID, and it must be funded on the principle of open collaboration with the industry, public authorities and academia.\nCEEMID uses the open source statistical programming language R, and various open source R programs. CEEMID also releases some of its customary program code developed to create its indicators. This allows an open collaboration with statisticians working in national statistics authorities and in independent research institutions in the EU and globally.\nThe use of open source software and the open source R statistical language allows a continuous peer-review of data ingestion, processing, corrections and indicator creation by statisticians, data scientists and academics. Statistical products of national statistical offices, sometimes Eurostat itself, not to mention data providers that are not part of the system of national statistical offices, such as the European Audiovisual Observatory, are plagued with data errors that are corrected and amended relatively slowly. We believe that unless the European Music Observatory becomes part of Eurostat (a highly unlikely organizational scenario), it should embrace the priniciples of open collaboration in creating its indicators.\nCEEMID has been releasing some of its data processing, integration and indicator creation code on an open-source license on the Comprehensive R Archive Network, or CRAN, is a collection of sites which carry identical material, consisting of the R distribution(s), the contributed extensions, documentation for R, and binaries. (More information in our documentation.) We would like to find funding to release thousands of reproducible data sets and the reproduction code from source to end result on an open data, open collaboration basis.\nOur economic impact assessment code Our iotables package programmatically creates gross-value added, employment, taxation effect and multiplier indicators from real national accounts data for all EU countries by providing a data processing and modelling software to implement the use cases of the Eurostat Manual of Supply, Use and Input-Output Tables. It was released on rOpenGov.\nThe package was originally designed for the economic impact assessment of film production in Hungary and for the Slovak music industry. (See related publication.) With the help of this package, we can, for example, calculate the effect of 1 million euro crisis relief package on the GDP, employment and future tax receipts between car manufacturing, banking, the music industry and book publishing in all EU countries. By releasing our software code, we could compare test results on calculating economic impact indicators for the creative industries and other industries with the UK statistical office. We want to release more and more of CEEMID\u0026rsquo;s software code, so that professional statisticians can validate that they work perfectly or suggest improvements.\nCreating regional indicators Our second major open-source release makes it possible to create regional statistical time series and data panels from Eurostat\u0026rsquo;s regional data - not only for the creative industries, although our original aim was to support scientific research into book piracy in a project with IVIR at the University of Amsterdam.\nWhile national borders do not change frequently, the borders of more than 1000 European NUTS1, NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions change on average every three years. The change of regional boundaries makes time-wise comparison very difficult. Because the current statistical regulations to do not make it compulsory that member states re-cast their historical data after a boundary change, Eurostat does not contain, for example, comparable data on French or Lithuanian or Hungarian regions in the previous decade.\nCEEMID\u0026rsquo;s program code does exactly this, because it traces, and whenever possible, corrects boundary changes back till 2007. We released this very complicated program code as part of the eurostat R package within the rOpenGov initiative. This program package has tens of thousands of users in research institutions, industry and in the national statistical offices themselves.\nWe released the program code, because it requires special geostatistical knowledge, and we believe it is such a critical application that only open peer-review can guarantee its flawless and error-free work.\nFrom the Centre of Europe to the European Music Observatory Historically CEEMID started out as the Central and Eastern European Music Industry Databases out of necessity following a CISAC Good Governance Seminar for European Societies in 2013. The adoption of European single market and copyright rules, and the increased activity of competition authority and regulators required a more structured approach to set collective royalty and compensations tariffs in a region that was regarded traditionally as data-poor with lower quantity of industry and government data sources available.\nIn 2014 three societies, Artisjus, HDS and SOZA realized that need to make further efforts to modernize the way they measure their own economic impact, the economic value of their licenses to remain competitive in advocating the interests vis-?-vis domestic governments, international organizations like CISAC and GESAC and the European Union. They signed a Memorandum of Understanding with their consultant to set up the CEEMID databases and to harmonize their efforts. The decentralized, data integration strategy chosen by CEEMID however allowed a quick expansion of CEEMID to be a Pan-European data resource.\n","date":1585053000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585053000,"objectID":"2f0b55297de4aae98e9abeefb0ca343a","permalink":"/post/2020-03-24-documentation/","publishdate":"2020-03-24T13:30:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-03-24-documentation/","section":"post","summary":"The Central European Music Industry Report 2020 was updated with a technical annex that points out to the new wiki documentation website of CEEMID to make our work more accessible for designing the European Music Observatory.","tags":["CEEMID","CCI","open-data","documentation","music-observatory"],"title":"Documenting CEEMID For Open Data Use","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":[],"content":"\rI have been searching around for a good incubation program for the transition of the data, software and of course people in the loose CEEMID network into a real company, and I was fascinated by the professionalism and unique viewpoint of Yes!Delft.\nI view on CEEMID as a professional success that brought together dozens of small entities with the help of dozens of dedicated people from the content side.

For me, the most important lesson was that it is not the team member who has the most desired or important technical skills who may be the best co-founder to make a successful organization, but the one who will best complement myself and other co-founders. Skills can be bought on the job market once the business model is validated and the revenues are coming. To get there, you need co-founders with a strong dedication, diverse educational and cultural background, and complementing psychological traits to overcome the difficulties of the first period, where the business model is not yet validated and there is no money coming in.\n","date":1582329600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584215737,"objectID":"bf8c668a338e4016bd31e1642d8daf27","permalink":"/post/yes-delft-co-lab/","publishdate":"2020-02-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/yes-delft-co-lab/","section":"post","summary":"CEEMID started as a cooperation project, not as an institution, and now, as the biggest music \u0026 creative sector data project in Europe, and most likely, in the world, it badly needs to re-organize its loose team around a new business model and a new organizational approach.","tags":["team-building"],"title":"Yes!Delft Co-Lab","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our reproducible reports are automated, self-refreshing documents, that contain data pipelines to the original data sources, the analytical code and the narrative assessment in a single file.

The program is refreshing the data visualizatoin, the data tables, the data citations and bibliography, and they re-create the statistical and descriptive technical annexes at every compilation.\nAdvantages of reproducible reporting A reproducible report allows independent assessment and duplication of the programmatic results. This is a guarantee of high quality and security.\n  Reviewability means that our application’s results are can be assessed and judged by our user’s experts, or experts they trust.\n  Reproducibility means that we are providing data products and tools that allow the exact duplication of our results during assessments. This makes sure that all logical steps can be verified. Reproducibility ensures that there is no lock-in to our applications. You can always chose a different data and software vendor, or compare our results with them.\n  We are creating applications that are confirmable and auditable. These are usually required by the ethical guidelines and professional standards of our users.\n  Confirmability means that using our applications findings leads to the same professional results as other available software and information. Our data products use the open-source statistical programming language R. We provide details about our algorithms and methodology to confirm our results in SPSS or Stata or sometimes even in Excel.\n  Auditability means that our data and software is archived in a way that external auditors can later review, reproduce and confirm our findings. This is a stricter form of data retention that most organizations apply, because we do not only archive results step-by-step but all computational steps – as if your colleagues would not only save every step in Excel but also their keystrokes. While auditability is a requirement in accounting, but we are extending this approach to all the quantiative work of a professional organization in an advisory or consulting capacity.\n  Because our data applications are confirmable and auditable, they are the best suited to meet the internal or external regulatory compliance of organizations, for example, reporting to external regulators or supervisory boards.\nInternationalization And Localization Because the tables, visualizations, citations and repeating technical documentations are created programatically, they are ideally suited for multi-language environments.

Since 2003 the EU and its members states have theoretically opened these vast data resources for the re-use of the market sector when there are no privacy or national security concerns present.\nRight after the opening of these data assets, it was estimated that the value of re-used public sector data, for example geographical, company registry, court, transport infrastructure data is around 25-47 billion euros. In the last 15 years, there have been signficant new investments into data assets, and futher innovation on using data.\nIn many cases, the re-usable public data offers a consistent and cheap alternative to private data collection, for example, pan-European surveying.\nAdvantages of PSI   There are vast data assets available for marginal cost, or for free, in size and value that could not be profitably financed by the private sector.\n  Re-use of taxpayer funded research increases the value for tax money, and avoids unnecessary duplication of data investments.\n  It is not possible to collect past data in the present. Public sources, however, often contain hidden data going back for 10-20 years or even more.\n  Difficulties of PSI   Re-usable data was created for a different purpose. While the data may be of high quality, it is likely not to be processed in the form the re-user wants to see it.\n  The data is often not documented, or not documented for the purpose of re-use.\n  The data is often difficult to find. It is technically re-usable, but even its existence is unknown for most business users.\n  The direct data costs of PSI are usually low - users only have to pay marginal costs, or sometimes they are not charged for a fair use of the data. However, the data processing costs are significant, because the data was not prepared for the business users needs. The data processing requires a special understanding of statistical standards and public data.

Our CEE Music Industry Report 2020 created with the help and support of Consolidated Independent was used as a use case for the problems.\nThis blog post is an edited version of Daniel\u0026rsquo;s presentation and the subsequent panel discussion with the stakeholders and organizers.\nThe CEE Report builds on the results of the first Hungarian, Slovak, Croatian and Czech music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.\nInvisibility The measurement problems and the ‘invisibility’ of creative and cultural industries is a consequence of the fact that these industries are predominantly comprised of microenterprises and individual, freelancing entrepreneurs. Even larger entities, such as collective management organizations can be classified as small enterprises. In the EU, small- and medium enterprises, and especially microenterprises usually have reduced reporting duties to the statistical authorities and tax authorities (which is the most important secondary source of government statistics in anonymized, aggregated form.) This means that the supply side is not visible for policymakers. The recommendation is to conduct sample-based surveys among these microenterprises, but very few member states do that.\nAnother problem is that on the demand side, not all member states create statistics. ESSNet-Culture created recommendations how to measure cultural access and participation, which is a broader term than cultural consumption, as it includes non-market forms, for example, liturgical music, amateur acting, and so on. The European Commission sometimes makes excellent, but not detailed CAP surveys, which are the most important sources of Eurostat’s relevant pan-European statistics.\nCEEMID has been making such surveys, both on the supply side (in music and film) and in the audience side (in music, film, theatre, opera, and artistic activities) in several member states, and has plenty of experience with using the EU-mandated CAP surveys of 2007 and 2013. The CEE report relies on the latter date set in first part of the audience analysis. Our work was already presented in 2015 as a best use case in Creating better national cultural statistics with Eurobarometer datasets and ESSNet-Culture technical recommendations at GESIS, which maintains the Eurobarometer archives, on the Eurobarometer Symposium Four Decades of Surveying Europe – Perspectives on Academic Research with the European Commission’s Eurobarometer Surveys\nFor the EU the lowest hanging fruit would be to critically assess the past surveys, including the partial CAP survey made in 2017 for the cultural heritage part of culture, and the national surveys conducted by CEEMID and its partners, and to mandate an annual or biannual CAP survey within the Eurobarometer series, probably as a specially sampled “Special Eurobarometer”. This would very significantly reduce the costs compared to a country-to-country basis, and probably could be shared by other institutions, for example, with the European Audiovisual Observatory. This alone would greatly increase the demand / consumption side information on the services of creative and cultural enterprises.\nIn the panel discussion Consolidated Independent highlighted the problem of leaving sample-based statistics making to the industry itself, which leads to myopical incentives to create ‘policy-based evidence’ that is cherry picked by industry trade associations to fit their often not very well thought out policy agenda. In our view, the most important role of a future European Music Observatory would be to set standards to data collection and integration. The music industry is one of the most data-rich industries globally, but the publicly available, verified, trustworthy information is scarce both for policy-making and for business planning among microenterprises who have know specialized research know-how. Our already existing, representative national surveys should and could be extended to the whole Europe with the quality control and visibility offered by such an Observatory.\nIndustry organization A very significant challenge with evidence-based policymaking, or, in fact, with any policy making is that the extremely fragmented nature of the industry makes national and EU-level consultations very difficult. Most of the workforce is neither a classical employer nor employee but works as a freelancer or a micro-entrepreneur. Their views are very rarely represented by trade unions or employee associations or chambers of commerce. Despite all efforts on EU level to make the social dialogue more representative for atypical and flexible work forms, the problems and the views of the creative and cultural sectors are largely unrepresented in policy debate.\nA prime example of this problem is the very heavy over-taxation of the music industry that we have shown in the Hungarian and Slovak national music industry reports, and in other documents in Croatia. The problem is not only characteristic for the music industry, but generally all CCIs because they share similar economic properties: no real chance to use tax breaks, high level of labour input and high level of value added. While policy makers and granting authorities spend much time on trying to improve the financing of this sector, in fact, reducing over-taxation would make a much more imminent impact on the liquidity, profitability and growth opportunities of the sector.\nHowever, in the making of economic and tax policies, the fragmented creative and cultural industries hardly can represent their special situation.\nPolicy issues Apart from taxation issues, which significantly reduce the liquidity, profitability and growth opportunities of these sectors in many EU countries, particularly in the CEE, where corporate taxes are low but value-added taxes are high, there are other important policy problem that reduce the long-term growth capacity of the sector.\nThe very small enterprise size leads to missing strategic human resources (HR) and research and development (R\u0026amp;D) functions in almost all enterprises – including simple market research activities. Companies with 1-2 employees do not have specialized management and support functions, and thus they have a very strong handicap in HR and R\u0026amp;D.\nA good example of this problem is the motion picture and TV industry. These industries were comprised of medium-sized enterprises in the 1980s with significant in-house education functions. The current structure of these industries, however, resembles music, with almost all enterprises staying below the 5-person threshold. In our experience, based on development needs assessments in the Hungarian motion picture and the Czech music industry, this creates an acute skills and labor shortage. Missing skills cannot be well replaced by recruitment, or with strategic HR development via life-long learning.\nSimilarly to very reduced opportunities to participate in, and create life-long learning schemes, there are very little chances to engage in market research and R\u0026amp;D. While the music industry, for example, is one of the most data-driven industries in the world, the microenterprise size does not allow that these enterprises commission market research or hire data scientists. This leads to very asymmetrical relationships with the main distributors of music and media content on platforms that are owned by global data companies.\nRecommendations Daniel made a few concrete recommendations in the panel.\n  Creating the European Music Observatory, and the creation of similar industry initiatives, and commissioning collaborative (multi-stakeholder) market research, as CEEMID works in many countries, can only replace the missing market research function in the extremely fragmented industries, such as motion picture production, the music industry, but to a certain degree architecture and design.\n  A low-hanging fruit would be a critical assessment of the previous Pan-European CAP surveys and the comparable national CAP surveys conducted by CEEMID and its partners following the ESSNet Culture recommendations and the inclusion of the CAP surveys in an annual or bi-annual form in the Eurobarometer (Special) series. A Special Eurobarometer may be more suitable because usually a non-proportional weighting of the sample gives the best value for money in these surveys.\n  Critically reviewing the participation of micro-enterprises in the current forms of social dialogue and looking for formal or informal ways to increase participation in policy making can gradually lead to more creative-friendly economic regulation and tax policies. The Hungarian Music Industry Report 2015 and the Slovak Music Industry Report 2019 contains very interesting case studies for this problem that we briefly summarize in the CEE Music Industry Report 2020.\n  Critically reviewing the few examples from mainly Nordic member states where collective agreements and other collaborative institutions allow microenterprises and freelancers to participate in life-long learning problems can help designing policies that will gradually reduce the huge skill gap of the CCIs in management know-how, data know-how, or renew their technical skills necessary in the production of their services and content. Our work with the Hungarian National Film Fund and surveys among more than a thousand film makers can give much insight into this problem.\n  Further links Our research findings were earlier presented and discussed in Vienna, Prague, Budapest and Bratislava with stakeholders.\nYou can follow Creative FLIP project on Twitter.\n","date":1580310000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580310000,"objectID":"e16a23b156aca94ce649126c85162b8d","permalink":"/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/","publishdate":"2020-01-29T16:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/","section":"post","summary":"The Central \u0026 Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020 was presented as a case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector.","tags":["market-report","music-industry","CCI","CEEMID","opendata","Armenia","Austria","Bulgaria","Czechia","Lithuania","Hungary","Slovakia","Serbia"],"title":"CCS Ecosystems: Evidence-Driven CCI Policy \u0026 The Central \u0026 Eastern European Music Industry Report","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"CEEMID \u0026amp; Consolidated Independent presented and discussed with stakeholders the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020 as a case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector on the CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference – a two-day high-level stakeholder event jointly organized by Geothe-Institute and the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission with the Creative FLIP project.\nThe CEE Report builds on the results of the first Hungarian, Slovak, Croatian and Czech music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.\nOur research findings were earlier presented and discussed in Vienna, Prague, Budapest and Bratislava with stakeholders.\nYou can find the earlier presentations in the blog section of the website.\nExecutive Summary The first Central European Music Industry Report is the result of a co-operation that started among stakeholders in three EU countries five years ago to measure the economic value added of music – the basis of a modern royalty pricing system. This gave birth to CEEMID, originally the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European Music Industry Databases, a data integration programme that now in 2020, covers all of Europe. CEEMID fulfils similar roles to the planned European Music Observatory and supports all pillars of the future pan-European system.\nThe comparison of Western and Eastern music audiences reveals key demographic differences that make the unchanged adoption of business practices from mature markets in the region questionable. Chapter 2 of this report will show these differences and their consequences on music markets, in terms of visiting and acquisition likelihood, frequency, seasonality and purchasing capacity. This is an example of how CEEMID fulfils the role of Pillar 3 (music, society and citizenship) in the planned European Music Observatory.\n Chapter 3 contrasts market demand with the supply strategies of musicians. CEEMID has been surveying music professionals, including artists, technicians and managers about their working conditions, market conditions and plans for five years across a growing number of countries. In 2019 we invited 100 national and regional stakeholders to distribute our surveys. In some countries, our surveys already have several years of historic data, making the resulting musician database probably the largest ever source of data about how music is produced and how musicians live. We are constantly looking for partners to roll out this survey to new countries in new languages.\nThe CEE region has comparative advantages in big music events like festivals, and it has become one of the most important hubs for cultural tourism in the world. We explain this phenomenon in Chapter 4 by showing the differences in demand composition, demography and supply of venues in the second chapter. The lack of a modern and dense network of permanent music venues gave rise to magnificent music festivals in the CEE. Open’er, Sziget and Exit are among the biggest and best festivals in the world, closely followed by several smaller festivals in all countries. The share of festivals in the live music market is many times higher than in Western Europe and they provide vital export revenues to the local music economies. However, they play a limited role in finding new audiences for local artists, as they are increasingly programming for Western audiences by providing shows of international hits. They can only very partially fill in the gaps left by the small venue problem that hit the emerging markets harder than the UK or Australia, where policy action had been already taken to reverse the decline of the availability of smaller live music venues.\nOn the recording side, our analysis shows that modern digital services are growing at a faster rate than in mature markets. Because of lower repertoire competition, streaming quantities are similar for a typical Austrian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish or Slovak track than in the mature markets. However, revenue growth is limited because of the interplay of several analysed factors. Our analysis of the live and recorded music markets shows that CEEMID fulfils the roles of the Pillar 1 (music economy) of the planned European Music Observatory.\nMost recorded music sales revenue in the region comes from streaming platforms, just like in the mature markets. Successful sales strategies require a solid knowledge of the global marketplace and the ability to understand and train sales algorithms. Micro-enterprises, such as independent labels, have very limited ability to cope with these functions, given that they do not have market research or R\u0026amp;D functions. CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have started initiating open, national R\u0026amp;D consortia to create the necessary concentration in data assets, analytical capacity and budgets to close this gap. As a first step, CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have created a large, independent music dataset based on hundreds of millions of royalty statement entries to create our market indexes, styled after stock market and bond market indexes. Streaming opportunities are fast changing as roll-out of streaming services is happening at a different rate in various territories; subscription charges and the exchange rate to the producer’s currency vary and repertoire competition emerges in the market. Our volume and revenue indexes in Chapter 5.3 are aimed at creating sales algorithms that optimize sales volumes and expected revenues. We believe that this analysis also reveals that CEEMID partially fulfils the roles of Pillar 2 (music diversity and circulation) and feeds important data into Pillar 4 (innovation).\nThe region has far bigger untapped potential than most music business executives believe. Households in the region spend a significantly lower share of their recreational budget on music than their Western, Southern or Nordic peers. The region has a lot of untapped cultural purchasing power because servicing is particularly challenging in both the live and recorded sides of the business.\nThis upside potential cannot be tapped without better pricing. Royalty levels are often very low in the region. Due to many combined effects analysed in this short report, the gap between royalties earned in the CEE and Western Europe is several times bigger than the difference in GDP or national average wage. These gaps are partly caused by special interests preventing collective management from charging appropriate tariffs for restaurants, media companies or electronic appliance importers and manufacturers, and partly by unfavourable taxation of cultural products and services.\nCEEMID was designed to create economic evidence on royalty pricing, private copying compensation and the creation of economic value added in the industry. In the first Hungarian Music Industry Report of ProArt and in the first Slovak Music Industry Report we have shown that economic and taxation policies of the CEE countries aimed to support car and electronics manufacturing create a distorted, unfavourable economic regime for creative industries. We want to help local stakeholders with economic evidence to correct these discriminatory policies during the overhaul of the EU VAT system. We have been helping various national organizations with economic evidence, presented in the light of latest EU jurisprudence, to improve their pricing activities. Our thousands of indicators were also used in ex ante evaluations of granting schemes.\nIn 2020, all EU member states will change their copyright administration legislation because of the national implementations of the 2019/790 Digital Single Market directive. CEEMID provides evidence in several countries about the size and impact mechanism of the value transfer, and generally the widespread use of the copyright exemption for private copying. We believe that the thousands of pan-European music industry indicators that we have aggregated over the five years will play a vital role in these regulatory processes.\nCEEMID fulfils its roles with a very thorough exploitation of the EU’s 17-years-old Open Data regime with the re-use of public sector information, and a very careful mapping of the music industry. These maps help us conduct annual surveys among musicians and the audience, and they help us connect (always with pre-approval and with a user mandate) to industry databases. We do not only cover the EU countries, but increasingly (potential) candidate countries and neighbourhood countries.\nIn our vision, this data collection and integration, i.e. Pillars 1-3 should be available for all music stakeholders, should remain public and publicly funded. The last Pillar of the observatory, innovation, is where private entities should compete. The founders of CEEMID and Consolidated Independent believe that this report demonstrates the business and policy benefits of such a system with the analysis of the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European music markets. We believe that this way CEEMID is in a position to serve most of the planned functions of the envisioned European Music Observatory, and we are looking for ways to make either our thousands of indicators, or our data collection and integration software open source and available for all stakeholders in the EU and its neighbours. CEEMID was born out of necessity to level out the different levels of public research and statistical coverage of the EU member states. In our view, private entities in the future should focus their investments in Pillar 4 of the planned observatory, i.e. competing in innovation with creating new models, algorithms and services based on data that is available throughout the European Union without giving further advantage to the already mature markets.\n","date":1580310000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580310000,"objectID":"5ee96ab1e81941d29fc0164f71dc9a4b","permalink":"/publication/ceereport_2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-29T16:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ceereport_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The results of the first Hungarian, Slovak, Croatian and Czech music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.","tags":["market-report","music-industry","Armenia","Austria","Bulgaria","Czechia","Lithuania","Hungary","Slovakia","Serbia"],"title":"Central \u0026 Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The most important technical guideline on cultural statistics is the Final Report of the Woking Group European Statistical System Network on Culture (in short: ESSnet-Culture) [@frank_guy_essnet-culture_2012].\nESSnet-Culture gave a thorough overview of cultural data sources, guidelines on standardizing data, and a technical definition of the domain, including an exact mapping of cultural and creative activities and occupations to statistical nomenclatures.\nICET model Cultural participation extends beyond the market-oriented forms of \u0026ldquo;cultural consumption\u0026rdquo; and include non-market forms, such as private copying or liturgical events.\nThe ESSnet-Culture working group endorsed the ICET model of quantifying cultural participation. The aim of the ICET model is to create representative surveys, but it is a very good framework to join survey data with other data sources. For example, the music industry and the audiovisual sector usually has extensive transaction data on most market-oriented activities.\n  Information: to seek, collect and spread information on culture;\n  Communication and community: to interact with others on cultural issues and to participate in cultural networks;\n  Enjoyment and expression: to enjoy exhibitions, art performances and other forms of cultural expression, to practice the arts for leisure, and to create online content;\n  Transaction: to buy art and to buy or reserve tickets for shows.\n  The generic questionnaire was developed by Jos de Haan and Andries van den Broek at the Netherlands Institute for Social Research, originally for extending cultural participation surveys to digital forms of culture [@de_haan_virtuele_2008; @de_haan_nowadays_2012]. This methodology was endorsed by ESSnet-Culture, and a rather detailed guideline can be found in the report of the Task Force on Cultural Practices And Social Aspects Of Culture, in the ESSNet-Culture technical report (in general: pp. 236-242, survey methodology and harmonization pp. 242-255, recommendations: pp. 273-274; with examples on how to use the question hierarchy on pp. 397-417.)\nTarget Population  When the target population is representative members of the general public, such as in the case of audience surveys, we use CAP surveys. When the target population is a professional or microenterprise group, such as performing artists or record labels, we use our Professional group surveys.  CAP surveys ESSnet-Culture has reviewed several pan-European CAP manifestations, and based on the recommendations, further CAP surveys were carried out in the European Union.\n  European CAP 2001: Europeans\u0026rsquo; Participation in Cultural Activities (2001)\n  CEE CAP 2003: Candidate Countries Eurobarometer 2003.1 New Europeans and Culture, all later EU member states of the EU27, except for Croatia, but including Turkey.\n  European CAP 2006: Within the EU-SILC Module 2006 On Social Participation.\n  European CAP 2007: Includes the EU27 + United Kingdom but not Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria, conducted within Eurobarometer European Cultural Values (2007)\n  European CAP 2013: Includes the EU27 + Croatia (only few weeks before the country\u0026rsquo;s accession.)\n  European CAP 2015: Within the EU-SILC Module 2015 On Social/Cultural Participation And Material Deprivation.\n  Based on these guidelines and examples, we have carried out several in-depth music and audiovisual domain oriented CAP surveys:\n  Hungary CAP 2014: a large, but non-representative online sample to test the methodology\n  Hungary CAP 2015:\n  Slovakia CAP 2015:\n  Croatia CAP 2017:\n  Hungary CAP 2017:\n  Hungary CAP 2018:\n  Hungary CAP 2019:\n  Slovakia CAP 2020:\n  Professional Group Surveys ","date":1566799200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566799200,"objectID":"43191971e350b0578ec6806d8cbfc155","permalink":"/project/music_observatory/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T08:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/music_observatory/","section":"project","summary":"Collaborative reproducible research in the music industry","tags":["ceemid","surveys","music-industry","observatory","reprodubile-research"],"title":"Surveys","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"An observatory is a location used for observing terrestrial or celestial events. The European Commission and the Council of Europe are supporting numerous data observatories to support research and development and evidence-based policymaking. We are creating automated observatories following the best practices of reproducible research.\nSatellite Report grew out of a such an observatory, CEEMID.\nHow To Start A Data Observatory?   A private observatory is a data integration system, which automatically collects external information, processes it and professionally joins it with internal data resources. We offer this to business, scientific research, think tank and NGO and journalism partners.\n  A collaborative observatory is a data integration system that has a map to collaborating institutions’s data resources, and is able to exploit their synergies by automatically combining their data, triggered by an authorization of all involved parties. We offer this to Consortia of various entities. Daniel\u0026rsquo;s CEEMID project developed since 2014 is a good example of a collaborative observatory.\n  A public observatory is a collaborative observatory that intends to make at least some of its data assets available as open data. ode chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. We offer this for the European Union and its Consortia. See some observatories »\n  Our observatories fulfil important functions in data collection, processing, integration, and automated modelling. We provide these services as custom software as service products in the form of data applications. To design a good observatory that fulfils your business, policy, scientific or journalistic needs, we provide data curating as a consulting service.\nA few public observatories:\n  The European Alternative Fuels Observatory is an European Commission funded initiative which provides open and free information, amongst others to support Member States with the implementation of EU Directive 2014/94 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. The EAFO is maintained by the EAFO Consortium.\n  The EU Energy Poverty Observatory (EPOV) is an initiative by the European Commission to help Member States in their efforts to combat energy poverty. It exists to improve the measuring, monitoring and sharing of knowledge and best practice on energy poverty, and it is developed by a consortium of universities, think tanks, and the business sector.\n  The European Observatory for Clusters and Industrial Change to help Europe\u0026rsquo;s regions and countries in designing better and more evidence-based cluster policies and initiatives. This platform is funded by the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME).\n  The Cluster Observatory of the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness at the Stockholm School of Economics, which started out originally as the European Cluster Observatory.\n  Reproducible research We believe that a modern data observatory should be as much reproducible and automated as possible.\n Following reproducible research principles leads to higher data quality, especially if it is based on open-source code. Reproducible data can be automatically documented, which makes teamwork, collaboration and instant use far more efficient. Reproducible research products offer far more efficient supervision and audit. Quality control is cheaper and easier.  Open source, open data, open collaboration In the EU, open data is governed by the Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information - in short: Open Data Directive (EU) 2019 / 1024. It entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the Public Sector Information Directive, also known as the ‘PSI Directive’ which dated from 2003 and was subsequently amended in 2013. The public sector offers tens of billions\u0026rsquo; euro worth data \u0026mdash; but without a free lunch. While the data is available free or at marginal cost, it is processed to the needs of public authorities, public services, and require special know-how to be put to a secondary business or research use. Our founder, Daniel, has been involved in Open Data and PSI since 2003. Our expertise guarrantee that in the field of economics, finance, social sciences, and most policy areas your observatory starts with hundreds, or even thousands of re-used public sector indicators, often with a decade-long or even longer history.\nWe use the open source statistical programming language R, and various open source R programs. We also release some of our mission-critical code developed to create business and policy indicators \u0026mdash; see eurobarometer, iotables, regions, retroharmonize. Our important code goes through anonymous peer-review, and open for external review, audit. For example, this allowed us to compare test results on calculating economic impact indicators for the creative industries and other industries with the UK statistical office. You can even modify our code \u0026ndash; you just cannot copyright and close it for commercial use. In our view, this guarrantees the highest quality, but it also gives assurrances of transparency and makes vendor lock-in impossible. While developing these packages requires our special knowledge, their rich and peer-reviwedd documentation makes sure that you can always find a team member, or hire a data analyst who can work with them without us.\nThe use of open source software and the open source R statistical language allows a continuous peer-review of data ingestion, processing, corrections and indicator creation by statisticians, data scientists and academics. Statistical products of national statistical offices, sometimes Eurostat itself, not to mention data providers that are not part of the system of national statistical offices, such as the European Audiovisual Observatory, are plagued with data errors that are corrected and amended relatively slowly.\nData integration instead of centralisation Our observatories by design are flexible and decentralized. Our continuous data integration allows to join and publish any data the observatory and its member have access to, and have rights and intentions to share or publish. We only keep metadata, i.e. a \u0026lsquo;data map\u0026rsquo; to make sure that whatever the Observatory\u0026rsquo;s members want to share or publish is always automatically available for processing and publication.\n","date":1551222000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551222000,"objectID":"e45ddef37b9c687e40dfaef2ff295921","permalink":"/project/observatory/","publishdate":"2019-02-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/observatory/","section":"project","summary":"Automated Data Observatory based on the principles of reproducible research","tags":["ceemid","surveys","music-industry","observatory","reprodubile-research"],"title":"Data Observatory","type":"project"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":["R"],"content":" iotables processes all the symmetric input-output tables of the EU member states, and calculates direct, indirect and induced effects, multipliers for GVA, employment, taxation.
