I have been a very long-time user of Charlie Thomson’s [spotifyr R package](https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr), which is probably the most used open-source music analytics software in the world.  It provides programmatic access to the Spotify Web API, which contains access to the former Echo Nest quantitative musicology engine.  

It is an essential part of the [Digital Music Observatory’s](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) streaming analysis and our [Listen Local](https://listenlocal.community/) apps designed for our trustworthy AI experiments and independent artist services.  I am extremely proud to announce that after a very thorough modernization of the package’s exception handling, documentation, and code dependencies that I did in the last week, the package has passed again the peer-review standards and it is back on CRAN.

The package is an excellent starting to point for R newbies to try their hands on musicology analysis with a few keystrokes. And of course, it is an essential part of the research infrastructure of musicology worldwide in far more advanced applications.

## Getting Started

You should start with the [README](https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr) and get your Spotify Web API access tokens to get started. 


### What Was the Beatles' Favorite Key?

``` r
library(spotifyr)
beatles <- get_artist_audio_features('the beatles')
```

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(knitr)

beatles %>% 
    count(key_mode, sort: TRUE) %>% 
    head(5) %>% 
    kable()
```

| key\_mode |   n |
|:----------|----:|
| C major   | 104 |
| D major   |  98 |
| G major   |  82 |
| A major   |  76 |
| E major   |  62 |

### Get your most recently played tracks

``` r
library(lubridate)

get_my_recently_played(limit: 5) %>% 
    mutate(
        artist.name: map_chr(track.artists, function(x) x$name[1]),
        played_at: as_datetime(played_at)
        ) %>% 
    select(
      all_of(c("track.name", "artist.name", "track.album.name", "played_at"))
      ) %>% 
    kable()
```

| track.name           | artist.name | track.album.name     | played\_at          |
|:---------------------|:------------|:---------------------|:--------------------|
| A Case of You        | Tristen     | A Case of You        | 2021-06-14 09:54:44 |

That's about right...

### Find Your All Time Favorite Artists

``` r
get_my_top_artists_or_tracks(type: 'artists', 
                             time_range: 'long_term', 
                             limit: 5) %>% 
    select(.data$name, .data$genres) %>% 
    rowwise %>% 
    mutate(genres: paste(.data$genres, collapse: ', ')) %>% 
    ungroup %>% 
    kable()
```

| name                | genres                                                                   |
|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Japanese Breakfast  | art pop, bubblegrunge, eugene indie, indie pop, indie rock, philly indie |
| Haley Bonar         | melancholia, stomp and holler                                            |
| Balthazar           | belgian indie, belgian rock, dutch indie, dutch rock, ghent indie        |
| Buildings Breeding  | indie fuzzpop                                                            |
| Angus & Julia Stone | australian indie folk, indie folk, stomp and holler                      |

What could I say?  I travelled Australia listening only to Angus & Julia Stone, the Buildings Breeding have been with me since I discovered them on my first iPod, in one of the first podcasts, the Indiefeed. I created my Kickstarter account back in 2010 to support Haley Bonar's third album. And the year before I was very much into Japanese Breakfast and Balthazar. 

### Find your favorite tracks at the moment

``` r
get_my_top_artists_or_tracks(type: 'tracks',

                             limit: 5) %>% 
    mutate(
        artist.name: map_chr(artists, function(x) x$name[1])
        ) %>% 
    select(name, artist.name, album.name) %>% 
    kable()

### What's the most joyful Joy Division song?

Let's take a look at the audio feature has to be `valence`, a measure of musical
positivity.

``` r
joy <- get_artist_audio_features('joy division')
```

``` r
joy %>% 
    arrange(-valence) %>% 
    select(.data$track_name, .data$valence) %>% 
    head(5) %>% 
    kable()
```

| track\_name                               | valence |
|:------------------------------------------|--------:|
| Passover - 2020 Digital Master            |   0.946 |
| Passover - 2007 Remaster                  |   0.941 |
| Colony - 2020 Digital Master              |   0.829 |
| Colony - 2007 Remaster                    |   0.808 |
| Atrocity Exhibition - 2020 Digital Master |   0.790 |

Now if only there was some way to plot joy…

A key mission of our [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/), which is our modern, subjective approach on how the future European Music Observatory should look like, is to not only to provide high-quality data on the music economy, the diversity of music, and the audience of music, but also on metadata.  The quality and availability, interoperability of metadata (information about how the data should be used) is key to build trustworthy AI systems. We rely on [spotifyr](https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr) to fulfil this mission.
