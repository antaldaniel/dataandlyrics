  HERE I WOULD INCLUDE A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO MARIE AND WHY WE ARE INTERVIEWING HER
  Please go ahead and extend it -->

*Zsigmond Gerlóczy is a 26 years old pianist, composer, improviser, music producer building bridges between musical genres. He currently lives in Budapest. He is inspired by many kind of music, such as Baroque, African and Indian folklore music, Jazz, Free improvisative music, Hip-Hop, Pop, Jewish lithurgical music, and basically every worthy music in the world… Although he has been playing music since the age of 5, he is just going to release his very first album this winter with Kriegler Records, his own newborn music label. We interviewed him because of our shared interest in how music crosses borders.*
