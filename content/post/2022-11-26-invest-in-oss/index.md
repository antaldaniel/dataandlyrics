In the European Union, the [FOSSEPS Critical Open Source Software Study Report](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/fosseps/news/fosseps-critical-open-source-software-study-report) earlier this year recommended that "European public services should actively contribute to the long-term sustainability of the open source software they use, by supporting long-term maintenance projects rather than purely focusing on new projects." But exactly how?

Carly Strasser, Kate Hertweck, Josh Greenberg, Dario Taraborelli and Elizabeth Vu recently published _Ten simple rules for funding scientific open source software_ in the in [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010627#abstract0) in a global perspective.

> Virtually all of research now relies on computational tools and infrastructure. In many fields, open source software (OSS) represents the foundation of these computational capabilities. This is particularly true in data-intensive scientific disciplines: Given the proliferation of large datasets that require domain-specific analyses and complex infrastructure to process, the role of OSS has evolved to critical infrastructure for research.

The conclusion of their article perhaps highlights best the current problem with funding practices, including those in the European Union. Projects tend to suffer from the novelty bias, and project, at least in the original meaning of the word, are temporary. Critical OSS however is permanent, growing, and requires constant maintenance from the OSS creator community.

> As datasets and computational power continue to grow, the role of OSS will also grow. Funders can help ensure that these projects are as useful, stable, and sustainable as possible by following the 10 rules above. A common thread in our rules is that support for OSS is not simply about funding a research project’s software development; instead, when supporting OSS funders should support people, not projects. […] Successfully running an impactful OSS project requires thoughtful community development, careful attention to [diversity, equity, and inclusion], and considerations for governance, management, and sustainability. Supporting OSS effectively and with an eye to the long term requires a holistic, people-centered approach.
